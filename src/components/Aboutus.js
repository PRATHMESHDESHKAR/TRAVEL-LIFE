            <p>Nurtured from the seed of a single idea ‘to empower the traveller with easy & instant travel bookings providing comprehensive choices’, Travel Life is a pioneer in India’s online travel space. 
            Over the years, we have partnered with many leading brands from the aviation & hospitality industries, creating fruitful partner relations for business expansion opportunities. We also entered the homestays & villas and continue to procure increased market share market in the same. With this, we also entered the ground transport space and commenced offering cab, bus & train booking services.

            <h1> OUR MISSION </h1>
            <p>As low-cost flight carriers were introduced in India, the number of Indians opting for online travel solutions also increased rapidly. And MakeMyTrip answered the call of the hour, by bringing the convenience of booking flights, hotels, and holiday packages in just a few clicks.
